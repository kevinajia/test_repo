      <description>Most of my Python skills were developed through various other classes I have taken through the elements of computing certificate. Some of these classes include data structures, software engineering, databases, and web programming. However I did pickup a few new skills from this class, including exposure to pandas and other Python libraries, and learning how to have R and python talk to each other with reticulate.
I learned that to look at datasets in Python, you must import pandas, a software library that is used for data manipulation and analysis.</description>

      <description>R Markdown This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com.
You can embed an R code chunk like this:
summary(cars) ## speed dist ## Min. : 4.0 Min. : 2.00 ## 1st Qu.:12.0 1st Qu.: 26.00 ## Median :15.0 Median : 36.00 ## Mean :15.4 Mean : 42.</description>

      <description>Modeling Instructions A knitted R Markdown document (preferably HTML) and the raw R Markdown file (as .Rmd) should both be submitted to Canvas by 11:59pm on the due date. These two documents will be graded jointly, so they must be consistent (i.e., donâ€™t change the R Markdown file without also updating the knitted document). Knit an html copy too, for later! In the .Rmd file for Project 2, you can copy the first code-chunk into your project .</description>

      <description>R Markdown This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com.
When you click the Knit button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:</description>
