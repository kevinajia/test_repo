## Introduction

The two datasets that I have chosen are the drinks dataset and the life_expectancy dataset. These two datasets interest me, because as a college student who enjoys going out for a drink with friends, I've always wondered about the real long term effects of alcohol on the human body, especially if it significantly affects life expectancy. The drinks dataset describes which coountries consume the most alcohol. The drinks dataset contains the variables country, total_litres_of_pure_alcohol, and servings. The country variable represents the country, the servings variable is split into beer_servings, spirit_servings, and wine_servings, and describes the total number of servings of each type of alcohol consumed by the respective country. The total_litres_of_pure_alcohol describes the total amount of pure alcohol consumed by each respective country. The life_expectancy dataset contains the variables country, year, status, life expectancy, and many other variables. The country variable represents the country. The year variable represents the year, ranging from 2000-2015. The life expectancy represents the average life expectancy for the country in that particular year. The drinks dataset was acquired from fivethirtyeight and the life_expectancy dataset was acquired from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who). I expect drinks and life expectancy to have a negative correlation, since it is generally believed that alcohol consumption is damaging to the body and can cause various types of cancers and shorten life expectancy.

## Tidying:

```{r}
drinks_tidy <- drinks %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = ends_with("servings"), names_to = "type", values_to = "servings") %>%
  mutate(
    type = str_sub(type, start=1, end=-10)
  ) %>%
  arrange(country, type)

life_expectancy_tidy <- read.csv("https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1eAh-MFQd2kV3R6rUXyQPDgUzkDwbKDcd")

```

## Joining/Merging

```{r}
drinks_life_joined <- drinks_tidy %>% left_join(life_expectancy_tidy, by = c("country"="Country"))

```

I joined drinks and life expectancy by country because I want to compare the life expectancy of each country with the amount of alcohol consumed. I joined by the 'country' variable. The drinks dataset had 579 observations of 4 variables and the life_expectancy dataset had 2938 observations of 22 variables before joining. After joining, the drinks_life_joined dataset has 7689 observations of 25 variables.

## Wrangling

```{r}
### filter()
big_drinkers <- drinks_life_joined %>% filter(total_litres_of_pure_alcohol >= 5)
head(big_drinkers)

### arrange()
biggest_drinkers <- drinks_life_joined %>% arrange(desc(total_litres_of_pure_alcohol))
head(biggest_drinkers)

### select()
country_drinks_lifeExpectancy <- drinks_life_joined %>% select(country, Year,  total_litres_of_pure_alcohol, Life.expectancy)
head(country_drinks_lifeExpectancy)

### mutate()
mutate_gallons <- drinks_life_joined %>% mutate(gallons = 0.264172 * total_litres_of_pure_alcohol)
head(mutate_gallons)

### summary statistic 1 - summarize()
summary <- drinks_life_joined %>% summarize(mean(Life.expectancy, na.rm=T), n(), n_distinct(country))
head(summary)

###  summary statistic 2 - summarize()
summary <- drinks_life_joined %>% summarize(mean(total_litres_of_pure_alcohol, na.rm=T), n(), n_distinct(country))
head(summary)

### summary statistic 3 - group_by(country) mean
groupby_country_mean <- drinks_life_joined %>% group_by(country) %>% summarize(mean_lifeExpectancy = mean(Life.expectancy, na.rm=T), mean_alc = mean(total_litres_of_pure_alcohol, na.rm=T))
head(groupby_country_mean)

### summary statistic 4 - group_by(country) , group_by(Year) mean
groupby_year <- drinks_life_joined %>% group_by(country) %>% group_by(Year) %>% summarize(mean_lifeExpectancy = mean(Life.expectancy, na.rm=T), mean_alc = mean(total_litres_of_pure_alcohol, na.rm=T))
head(groupby_year)

### summary statistic 5 - group_by() sd
groupby_life_sd <- drinks_life_joined %>% group_by(country) %>% summarize(sd_lifeExpectancy = sd(Life.expectancy, na.rm=T))
head(groupby_life_sd)

### summary statistic 6 - group_by() sd drinks
groupby_drinks_sd <- drinks_life_joined %>% group_by(type) %>% summarize(sd_drinks = sd(servings, na.rm=T))
head(groupby_drinks_sd)

### summary statistic 7 - group_by() min life expectancy
groupby_country_min <- drinks_life_joined %>% group_by(country) %>% summarize(min_lifeExpectancy = min(Life.expectancy, na.rm=T))
head(groupby_country_min)

### summary statistic 8 - group_by() max life expectancy
groupby_country_max <- drinks_life_joined %>% group_by(country) %>% summarize(max_lifeExpectancy = max(Life.expectancy, na.rm=T))
head(groupby_country_max)

### summary statistic 9 - group_by() median life expectancy
groupby_country_med <- drinks_life_joined %>% group_by(country) %>% summarize(med_lifeExpectancy = median(Life.expectancy, na.rm=T))
head(groupby_country_med)

### summary statistic 10 - group_by() median drinks
groupby_drinks_med <- drinks_life_joined %>% group_by(country) %>% summarize(med_total_litres_of_pure_alcohol = median(total_litres_of_pure_alcohol, na.rm=T))
head(groupby_drinks_med)

```

For the filter() dplyr function, I filtered by countries with a total alcohol consumption of greater than 5 litres. For the arrange() dplyr function I arranged the total alcohol by countries in decreasing order. For the select() dplyr function, I selected by country, year, total liters of alcohol, and life expectancy. For the mutate() dplyr function, I added a new column that converted liters of alcohol for each country into gallons, so that it is easier to visualize for me. For 2 of the summarize() dpylr functions I summarized by mean life expectancy for one and mean total alcohol consumption for the second. I grouped by country while summarizing by mean life expectancy and mean alcohol consumption. I also grouped by country and year while summarizing by mean life expectancy and mean alcohol consumption. I grouped by country while summarizing by standard deviation of life expectancy. I grouped by type of alcoholic drink type while summarizing by standard deviation of servings of alcoholic drinks. I grouped by country and summarized by max and min life expectancies. I grouped by country while summarizing by median life expectancy and median total amount of alcohol consumed.

## Visualizing

```{r}
drinks_le = subset(drinks_life_joined, select=-c(country, type, Status))
glimpse(drinks_le)
drinks_le%>%select_if(is.numeric)%>%
  cor%>%as.data.frame%>%
  rownames_to_column%>%pivot_longer(-1)%>%
  ggplot(aes(rowname,name,fill=value))+geom_tile()+
  geom_text(aes(label=round(value,2)))+
  xlab("")+ylab("")+coord_fixed()+
  scale_fill_gradient2(low="red",mid="white",high="blue")


```


There is a strong positive correlation between servings and total_litres_of_pure_alcohol. There does not seem to be correlations between other variables according to the correlation heatmap.

```{r}
ggplot(data = drinks_life_joined, aes(x = total_litres_of_pure_alcohol, y = Life.expectancy, fill = Year)) + geom_point(size=2, aes(color = Year)) + geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE) + ggtitle("Total alcohol consumption vs life expectancy") + labs(x = "Total liters of alcohol", y = "Life expectancy") + scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(0,15,1)) + theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = "bold", color = "purple"))
```


There appears to be a weak positive correlation between alcohol consumption and life expectancy. From the graph, it appears that people living in countries with higher alcohol consumption tend to have longer life expectancies. This contradicts my prediction that total alcohol consumption and life expectancy would have a negative correlation. There appear to be several outliers in the graph.

```{r}
ggplot(data = drinks_life_joined, aes(x = total_litres_of_pure_alcohol, y = Life.expectancy, fill = Year)) + geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE) + ggtitle("Total alcohol consumption vs life expectancy") + labs(x = "Total liters of alcohol", y = "Life expectancy") + theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = "bold", color = "orange")) +  facet_wrap(drinks_life_joined$Year) + geom_bar(stat='summary', fun.y = mean)

```


There appears to be a weak positive correlation between alcohol consumption and life expectancy for every year from 2000 to 2015. From the graphs, it appears that countries with higher amounts of alcohol consumption tend to have higher life expectancies. This contradicts my prediction that total alcohol consumption and life expectancy would have a negative correlation. 


## Dimensionality Reduction

```{r}
drinks_life_joined1 <- drinks_life_joined %>% select(-country, -type, -Status)
drinks_life_joined1 <- drinks_life_joined %>% select_if(is.numeric) %>% scale
rownames(drinks_life_joined1) <- drinks_life_joined$Name
drinks_life_pca <- princomp(na.omit(drinks_life_joined1))
names(drinks_life_pca)
```

Take the drinks_life_joined dataset and clean the data by grabbing all numerics except country, type and status. Normalize the data and run princomp() on the scaled data and decide how many principal components to keep. Visualise and interpret the data.

```{r}
eigval<-drinks_life_pca$sdev^2 #square to convert SDs to eigenvalues
varprop=round(eigval/sum(eigval), 2) #proportion of var explained by each PC
ggplot() + geom_bar(aes(y=varprop, x=1:22), stat="identity") + 
  geom_text(aes(x=1:22, y=varprop, label=round(varprop, 2)), vjust=1, col="white", size=5) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(0, .6, .2), labels = scales::percent) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=1:10) + 
  labs(title = "Proportion of Variance vs PCs", x = "Principle Component", y = "Variance Proportion")
```

Square to convert SDs to eigenvalues. To decide how many PCs to keep, plot the proportion of variance explained by each PC from largest eigen value to smallest ("a scree plot"). To determine how many PCs to keep: pick PCs until the scree plot flattens, picks PCs until cumulative proportion of variance is greater than 80%, and pick PCs whose eigenvalues are greater than 1(Kaiser's rule).

```{r}
preparedData <- drinks_life_joined%>%ungroup()%>%select(-country, -type, -Status)
nums <- preparedData%>% select_if(is.numeric) %>% scale
drinks_life_pca <- princomp(na.omit(nums))
summary(drinks_life_pca, loadings=T)
```


```{r}
library(factoextra)
fviz_pca_biplot(drinks_life_pca)
```

A biplot combines a loadings plot with a PC score plot. The variables that extend into the first quadrant are positively correlated for PC1 and positively correlated for PC2. The variables that extend into the second quadrant are negatively correlated for PC1 and positively correlated for PC2. The variables that extend into the third quadrant are negatively correlated for PC1 and negatively correlated for PC2. The variables that extend into the fourth quadrant are positively correlated for PC1 and negatively correlated for PC2.




Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
